# Updates and upgrades to MacFusion and its plug-ins #

[Changelog](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/CHANGELOG)

# MacFusion 1.0 (2007-04-22) #

Publicised at the [MacFusion home page](http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/). Reference from that page to release 1.0 (and other **RELEASES**) [may](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=85) overlap with less publicly available **BETAS**.

As we have two communities of users — (1) those using releases and (2) those using betas between releases — it is **extremely important for all issue reports to state version numbers and other information required for [quick fixes](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/quick)**.

1.0 [may](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=62&can=2&q=downloads#makechanges) be added to the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/downloads/list) area.
