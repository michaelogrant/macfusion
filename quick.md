# A quick fix #

  * begin by searching for your issue
    * there may be a solution, or a workaround, or explanations, or a fix in the pipeline
  * if you add a new issue to the list, please help the community to help you — take two minutes to state in your report:
    1. the plugged-in file system/protocol that you are using
    1. the [version of MacFUSE](MacFUSEversion.md)
    1. the version of MacFusion
    1. the version of Mac OS X
    1. the type of Internet connection at the time of the issue
    1. the upload and download speeds that you normally associate with that connection
    1. whether the remote server to which your issue relates normally provides steady upload and download speeds (or, are there peaks, troughs and pauses noticeable if you use more traditional FTP/SFTP clients?)
    1. other basic information that will help us to understand your situation
  * if you have two more issues, please [create a separate issue](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/entry) for each one. In this way, issues become less confusing for the wider audience.

Alongside the MacFUSE community, at any one time we may have **FOUR or more communities of MacFusion users** — those using the very prominent **RELEASES**, those using less prominent **BETA** versions of MacFusion — and users of our MacFusion as a GUI to MacFUSE from the Fink and macports communities. Version numbers are typically the **first essential consideration** in the troubleshooting process.
