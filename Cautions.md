# Cautions #

Please observe the terms and conditions of [licenses](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/) :)

If you choose to use MacFusion in a production environment, please:

  1. ensure that your requirements are properly met by:
    * sshfs-static and other technologies bundled _within_ MacFusion
    * MacFUSE and other technologies upon which MacFusion _depends_
  1. satisfy yourself that the services and disks to which you connect are wholly compatible:
    * with all of the above
    * in all environments/situations in which you expect to use them.

Here for example is an [issue](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=25) involving Word 2004, sleeping and changing locations … this _might_ be resolved by use of an option … but until we experiment with options in earnest through a MacFusion interface, we can't be sure what's required by Microsoft — Office is known to behave in extraordinary ways!

If you encounter any issues that have not previously been noted, please [report them](http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/list?can=2&q=&sort=priority&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary).

Thank you!
