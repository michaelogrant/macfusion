#summary clarifications, distinctions, explanations

= Clarifications =

Please refer to the [http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/ MacFusion home page].

= Distinctions =

[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/ MacFusion] is a [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/FileSystemsToImplement filesystem plug-in]-based GUI for [http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2007/01/taming-mac-os-x-file-systems.html MacFUSE].

Bundled within the SSHFS [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/FileSystemsToImplement plug-in] for MacFusion is an sshfs-static binary.

The sshfs-static binary bundled within the [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/FileSystemsToImplement plug-in] to version 1.0 of [http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/ MacFusion] may differ slightly from the [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/MACFUSE_FS_SSHFS MacFUSE version of the SSH file system (sshfs)] that's bundled within sshfs.app. 

sshfs.app may appear in the [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/downloads/list MacFUSE downloads area] but please note: whilst the sshfs-static binary within the bundle is supported, the sshfs.app (application bundle) in its entirety is an *[http://groups.google.com/group/macfuse-devel/browse_thread/thread/5dbb1af9eb4b3e06?tvc=2&fwc=1# unsuppported]Â demo*.

If your current version of MacFusion does not serve your requirements, please consider [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/MacFusionUpdates updating].

If you encounter any issues that have not previously been noted, please [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/list?can=2&q=&sort=priority&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary report them].

Issues that relate to the sshfs-static binary -- not to MacFusion -- can be found/reported in the [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/issues/list?can=2&q=sshfs&sort=priority&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary MacFUSE issues area]. 

(Issues that relate to the sshfs.app demo should *never* be reported.)

Non-technical users will probably be baffled by those distinctions. 

User-friendly explanations from MacFusion project members will be warmly welcomed!
