== Updates to MacFUSE and MacFusion ==

If an [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/CHANGELOG update to MacFUSE] appears before an [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/CHANGELOG update to MacFusion], should I refrain from updating my MacFUSE installation?

  * At launch time, MacFusion performs MacFUSE-oriented checks
    * if your *only* use of MacFUSE is for MacFusion, await advice from MacFusion developers before updating or upgrading MacFUSE
    * if MacFusion is not tested with a particular version of MacFUSE, MacFusion may (properly) not launch 
    * if a security issue arises, exceptional action may be advised.

Unless advised otherwise, please:
  # set the MacFusion preference to [√] Check for Updates on Startup
  # wait for MacFusion to announce recommended updates.
    * MacFusion uses Sparkle technology to automate these announcements and installations.
  
Will MacFusion's Sparkle configuration announce updates to MacFUSE as well as MacFusion?

  * MacFusion 1.0 is a menu extra without a Dock icon
    * look for the grey globe+arrows icon in your menu bar
    * probably to the left of other icons with which you're familiar
    * the [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/list?can=2&q=label%3Amenus+OR+label%3AMenuExtraIcon&sort=priority&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary menu extra icon and menus in general] are discussed amongst the other issues.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=156 Dock and menu extra preferences] may appear in a future release. 

== How do I install, disable or remove plug-ins for MacFusion? ==
Recommended:

After using Finder to manipulate any plug-in:
