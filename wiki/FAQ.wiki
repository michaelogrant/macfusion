== Updates to MacFUSE and MacFusion ==

If an [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/CHANGELOG update to MacFUSE] appears before an [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/CHANGELOG update to MacFusion], should I refrain from updating my MacFUSE installation?

  *  Unless advised otherwise, please wait for your copy of MacFusion to announce and install recommended updates
    * MacFusion uses Sparkle technology to automate these announcements and installations.
  
Will MacFusion's Sparkle configuration announce updates to MacFUSE as well as MacFusion?

== Why am I not receiving notifications of updates to issues that I have _reported_ ? ==

  * This seems to be an issue with the Google Code web site. If you are affected, you may: 
    # add relevant comments to [http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=227 issue *227*]
    # review your [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings Google Code Settings].

== I reviewed my Google Code Settings, they are correct. Why am I not receiving notifications of updates to issues that I have _reported_ ? ==

  * This seems to fall under the same umbrella. If you are affected, you may: 
    * add relevant comments to [http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=227 issue *227*].

== Why am I not receiving notifications of updates to _other_ people's issue reports that have been starred by me? ==

  * This seems to be a *separate* issue with the Google Code web site. If you are affefcted, you may:
    # add relevant comments to the [http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=228 issue *228*]
    # change your [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings Google Code Settings].

== Why can't I find my way back to the Google Code Settings tab without visiting these FAQ? ==

  * This seems to be a *separate* issue with the Google Code web site. If you are affected, you may: 
    * add relevant comments to [http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=168#c5 issue *168*]
      *  We have asked for that issue summary to be renamed `Settings tab is invisible to _group_ members who are not _project_ members`

== How do I alter or specify options that are not revealed in the current version of MacFusion? ==

  *  Advanced and other options may be entered in Terminal, at the command line
    * certain commands/options/debugging environments may require use of a particular shell; do not assume that tcsh or bash are universally appropriate
    * if you're not comfortable with shells and command-line environments, please await the [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/MacFusionUpdates next release of MacFusion] :)

== How can I make sshfs-static more easily available at the command line? ==

  * This is not a MacFusion question, but the tendency is to create a symbolic link
    * from `sshfs` at `/usr/local/bin`
    * to the `sshfs-static` binary that's bundled within the plug-in within MacFusion.

== How do I create a symbolic link? ==

  * Again, not a MacFusion question; if you're unfamiliar with symlinks then it's advisable to educate yourself regarding use of shells and command lines. That said, there's a GUI (contextual menu item) that you might find useful:
