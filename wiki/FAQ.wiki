  * MacFusion 1.0 is a menu extra without a Dock icon
    * look for the grey globe+arrows icon in your menu bar
    * probably to the left of other icons with which you're familiar
    * the [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/list?can=2&q=label%3Amenus+OR+label%3AMenuExtraIcon&sort=priority&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary menu extra icon and menus in general] are discussed amongst the other issues.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=156 Dock and menu extra preferences] may appear in a future release. 

== How do I install, disable or remove plug-ins for MacFusion? ==

After using Finder to manipulate plug-ins: 
  # Quit from MacFusion
  # re-launch MacFusion.

   * In this wiki we have some [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/Explanations explanations].
   * If any explanation is lacking, please do not hesitate to [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/list?can=2&q=Type:Enhancement&sort=priority&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary request an improvement].

== Updates to MacFUSE and MacFusion ==

If an [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/CHANGELOG update to MacFUSE] appears before an [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/wiki/CHANGELOG update to MacFusion], should I refrain from updating my MacFUSE installation?

  * Unless advised otherwise, please:
    # set the MacFusion preference to [√] Check for Updates on Startup
    # wait for MacFusion to announce recommended updates.
  * MacFusion uses Sparkle technology to automate these announcements and installations.
  
Will MacFusion's Sparkle configuration announce updates to MacFUSE as well as MacFusion?
