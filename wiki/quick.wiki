= A quick fix =

  * begin by searching for your issue
    * there may be a solution, or a workaround, or explanations, or a fix in the pipeline
  * if you add a new issue to the list, please help the community to help you — remember to state in your report:
    # the [MacFUSEversion version of MacFUSE]
    # the version of MacFusion
    # the version of Mac OS X
    # other basic information that will help us to understand your situation.

Alongside the MacFUSE community we have *two communities of MacFusion users* — those using the very prominent *RELEASES*, and those using less prominent *BETA* versions of MacFusion — so version numbers are typically the *first essential consideration* in the troubleshooting process.
