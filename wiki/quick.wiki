= A quick fix =

  * begin by searching for your issue
    * there may be a solution, or a workaround, or explanations, or a fix in the pipeline
  * if you add a new issue to the list, please help the community to help you — take two minutes to state in your report:
    # the [MacFUSEversion version of MacFUSE]
    # the version of MacFusion
    # the version of Mac OS X
    # the type of Internet connection at the time of the issue 
    # the upload and download speeds that you normally associate with that connection
    # whether the remote server to which your issue relates normally provides steady upload and download speeds (or, are there peaks, troughs and pauses noticeable if you use more traditional FTP/SFTP clients?)
    # other basic information that will help us to understand your situation
  * if you have two more issues, please [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/entry create a separate issue] for each one. In this way, issues become less confusing for the wider audience. 

Alongside the MacFUSE community, at any one time we may have *FOUR or more communities of MacFusion users* — those using the very prominent *RELEASES*, those using less prominent *BETA* versions of MacFusion — and users of our MacFusion as a GUI to MacFUSE from the Fink and macports communities. Version numbers are typically the *first essential consideration* in the troubleshooting process.
