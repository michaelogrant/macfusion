== forthcoming (abstracted from Subversion log for revision 201) ==

  * Basic [issue checks for compatibility between versions of MacFUSE and MacFusion].
  * Context menu for the Favorites view.
  * curlftpfs and sshfs plug-ins: for users of Fink and MacPorts, [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=90 recognise alternate paths to libfuse].

  * Fixed an issue with [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=77 selection changing discontinuously].
  * Fixed the OK button to save [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=88 paths] and [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=78 sshfs options].
  * Improved [http://code.google.com/p/macfusion/issues/detail?id=80 resizing of log window].
  * New option: duplicate an existing favourite.
  * UI improvements.
