This is a GUI for arbitrary FUSE filesystems designed to use the MacFuse backend recently ported by Google. It has a plugin architecture so each filesystem can provide its own UI and other methods, while integrating into the overall application. The goal is to make FUSE filesystems like SSH, FTP, Subversion, and others easily accessible to mac users.
